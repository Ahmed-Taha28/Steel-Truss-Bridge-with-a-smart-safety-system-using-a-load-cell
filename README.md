# Concept

This project introduces an innovative Smart Bridge Health Monitoring System that integrates structural engineering principles with real-time electronic monitoring using Arduino Uno. The system continuously assesses bridge structural integrity, detects potential overload conditions, and provides immediate visual and auditory alerts when concerning stress levels or obstructions are detected.
